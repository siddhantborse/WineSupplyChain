# WineSupplyChain
This project addresses critical challenges in the wine supply chain, such as counterfeiting, traceability, and regulatory compliance, using SHA-based data integrity solutions. Each stage of production—from grape cultivation to retail—benefits from a secure, tamper-proof record, ensuring product authenticity and boosting consumer trust.
